# Why I Started Learning Perl
#### IF YOU WANT TO KNOW, THIS IS MY STORY

I didnâ€™t originally plan to learn Perl, but hereâ€™s the backstory.<!-- more --> Back in 2018, I bought a book titled *Bahasa Pemrograman Perl* by [Askari Azikin](https://github.com/kariibm) published in 2013. I stumbled across it at [Penerbit Informatika](https://penerbitinformatika.com/kontak/) on Jln. *Bauh Batu No. 52 Bandung*, and thought it might be interesting. It cost me around Rp 50k (i forget the actual amount), but I never actually opened it. It sat on my shelf collecting dust for years.

Recently, out of curiosity, I decided to finally crack open the book and see what Perl was all about. I wasnâ€™t looking for any specific language at the timeâ€”I was just interested in broadening my programming knowledge. Now that Iâ€™ve started diving into it, it seems Perl might be useful for scripting ðŸ˜…, and it might serve as a good foundation for additional programming concepts.

I donâ€™t plan to dive too deeply into it. I canâ€™t quite explain why, but it feels like focusing on Perl would be a waste of time for me. Not because Perl is a bad language, but because its ecosystem and environment havenâ€™t evolved much in recent years. In a landscape where newer technologies are thriving, Perl feels somewhat outdated. (somehow I think [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/), [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/), and [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) are more worth the time and effort to dive into rather than [perl](https://www.perl.org/)). So, I donâ€™t see it becoming a major focus in my learning path. But for now, I will finish my understanding of what I need from this book.
