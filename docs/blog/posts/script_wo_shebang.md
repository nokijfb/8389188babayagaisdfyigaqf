# Script w/out #!
#### HAVE YOU EVER IMAGINED IT

*Running Scripts Without Shebang: Is It Really an Issue?*

Seriously, when I first started writing scripts, to be honest, I never paid much attention to the small details like the shebang (`#!/usr/bin/perl`). All I knew was, if I wanted to run a script, I just had to type `interpreter_command filename.ext`, and everything would work fine. But these day, I found myself wondering, *"Do I really need to include that shebang every time?"*<!-- more -->

At first glance, the shebang seemed optional, a relic of the past maybe (mwhehehe.. (• ω •)ﾉ). After all, I could run my scripts perfectly well without it by just typing `interpreter_command filename.ext`. So why bother adding it?, Have you ever thought the same thing as I did?

#### The Turning Point

Things changed when I started experimenting with automating tasks. I wanted to schedule a simple Perl script to run every day at midnight using a cron job. I added my script to the cron table, specifying the full path, and waited. Midnight came, and… nothing. No output, no logs, no errors.

It just an example, kind looks like this:
```bash linenums="1"
0 0 * * * /path/to/script.pl
```

After digging through some documentation, I realized the problem: the system didn’t know it needed to use Perl to interpret my script. Without the shebang, the cron job didn't know what to do with the file.

When I added the shebang at the top of the script like this (again, it's just an example):

```perl linenums="1"
#!/usr/bin/env perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $log_file = '/path/to/log.txt';
open(my $fh, '>>', $log_file) or die "Could not open file '$log_file' $!";
print $fh "Cron job ran at: " . localtime() . "\n";
close $fh;
```

And updated the cron job:

```bash
0 0 * * * /path/to/script.pl
```

Everything worked perfectly. That was my first lesson—if you want your scripts to run automatically, the shebang helps the system figure out what interpreter to use.

>For those who don't know what **cron jobs** are:<br> 
>**Cron jobs** are scheduled tasks that run automatically at specified times on Unix-based systems. They’re great for automating repetitive tasks like running scripts or backups. You define these jobs in a file called crontab with a simple time-based syntax

#### Distribution and Compatibility

Fast forward a bit, I was now sharing scripts with others. When I sent one of my Perl scripts to a colleague who was using a different environment, they tried running it directly with `./script.pl` and got an error. Turns out, they didn’t realize they needed to explicitly type `perl script.pl`. Another lesson learned—the shebang makes scripts executable directly without worrying about which interpreter the system should use.

And then there’s the issue of different versions. Some systems might have multiple Perl installations, and without the shebang, you can’t control which one gets used. With a shebang like `#!/usr/bin/perl5.32`, you can force the system to use a specific version of Perl. It saved me from running into compatibility issues more than once.

#### The Bottom Line

So, is the shebang mandatory in every scripting language? No, not really. You can get rid of it if you’re just running scripts manually. But if you ever plan to automate tasks, share your scripts, or work in environments where multiple versions of interpreters exist, having a shebang becomes really useful. It’s a small detail, but it can save you a lot of headaches down the road.

In the end, I started adding the shebang not because I had to, but because I realized how much smoother things were with it in place. It’s like leaving a note for the system, telling it exactly what to do.
