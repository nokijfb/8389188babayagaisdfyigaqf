#### WPORG vs WP ENGINE

[WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/) has rebranded WP Engine's [Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)](advancedcustomfields.com) plugin to "Secure Custom Fields,"<!-- more --> aimed at resolving security issues and eliminating commercial upsells. [Matt Mullenweg](https://x.com/photomatt), co-founder of [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/), described the situation as rare, stemming from WP Engine's legal disputes with (Automattic)[https://automattic.com/]. This unprecedented action has sparked concerns, as [WP Engine](https://wpengine.com/) claims such a takeover has never occurred without consent from the plugin's creator.
