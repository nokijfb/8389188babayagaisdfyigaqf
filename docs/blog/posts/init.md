Today I built a website for my devlog (**Developer Blog**) as a documentation of my future learning activities.<br> The material Iâ€™m currently working through is from *[Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/think-python-2nd/9781098129361/?_gl=1*odl6f*_ga*MTY2NTMyNjIyNi4xNzI2NzM5ODQy*_ga_092EL089CH*MTcyNjczOTg0Mi4xLjEuMTcyNjczOTg0OS41My4wLjA.)*<br> ebook by *[Allen B. Downey](https://www.oreilly.com/search/?q=author%3A%22Allen%20B.%20Downey%22&rows=100)*, published by *[O'Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/)*.
