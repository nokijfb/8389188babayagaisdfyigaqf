I became acquainted with programming back in 2015. However, I wasn't able to focus on it at that time due to my commitment to my job as a customer service representative. Additionally, learning resources were scarce and often required unaffordable fees. Because of this, I began to focus more seriously on programming in 2023. The shift happened because learning resources have become much more accessible and often free, making it easier to dive in with a strong commitment and consistent effort.

My interests span a wide range of technologies and programming languages, with a particular fascination for Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, as I am still building my foundational knowledge, I am starting with the basics.

Currently, I am concentrating on full-stack web development. For the front-end, I am learning [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com) language. For the back-end, I am focusing on [Python](https://www.python.org) due to its extensive libraries and frameworks, which are increasingly important for both current and future needs.

I am excited about the journey ahead and look forward to the opportunities that lie in the world of programming and technology.
