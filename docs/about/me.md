I became acquainted with programming in 2015, but at the time, I couldn’t focus on it due to my role as a customer service representative. Learning resources were also scarce and often came with unaffordable fees. In 2023, I shifted my focus to programming more seriously, thanks to the increased accessibility of learning resources in recent years, many of which are now available for free. This made it easier to commit fully and consistently to pivoting to becoming a programmer.

My interests span a wide range of technologies and programming languages, with a particular focus on Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). While still building a strong foundation, I’ve decided to start with the basics.

Currently, my focus is on full-stack web development. On the front-end, I’m using JavaScript, while on the back-end, I’m working with Python due to its extensive libraries and frameworks, which are crucial for both present and future needs.

I’m excited to embrace new opportunities in the ever-evolving world of programming and technology.
